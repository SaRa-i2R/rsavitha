 I am a Principal Investigator and research group leader at Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore. My current research interests are in life long learning in artificial neural networks, primarily focused on analysis of irregularly sampled, multi-variate and non-stationary time series data. Earlier, I received my PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2011. Thereafter, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at Nanyang Technological University until 2013. I am humbled to be listed in the inaugural 100 Women in Technology, Singapore (https://www.scs.org.sg/awards/sg100wit-n-to-s)
